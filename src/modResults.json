I think I would learn a lot at Nationwide in this position but Iwant to be absolutely certain and I don't feel as if I can make aneducated decision without more time. I would like to request at least 1more week to make a decision on the offer 2 more weeks would be preferredbut I understand if that can not work for the company. Thanks forunderstanding and I look forward to hearing from youBestCody PhilipsOn Thu Oct 22 2015 at 327 PM <BLANKA1@nationwide.com>","subject":"Re: Offer Details","references":["OF1E70DB52.F930BF9E-ON85257EE6.006A6B66-85257EE6.006AE3BF@nationwide.com"],"messageId":"CA+oWL+vyY1qaN6Fzew+PG5dtHNbGRKMdMZLdiBA9Wm3EjthjSA@mail.gmail.com","priority":"normal","date":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 01:35:34 -0400","replyTo":["OF1E70DB52.F930BF9E-ON85257EE6.006A6B66-85257EE6.006AE3BF@nationwide.com"],"to":"philipcr@miamioh.edu"},{"text":"","subject":"Re: Offer Details","references":["OF1E70DB52.F930BF9E-ON85257EE6.006A6B66-85257EE6.006AE3BF@nationwide.com","CA+oWL+vyY1qaN6Fzew+PG5dtHNbGRKMdMZLdiBA9Wm3EjthjSA@mail.gmail.com"],"messageId":"OFA678C183.70126DD7-ON85257EEC.004669C9-85257EEC.004830F8@nationwide.com","priority":"normal","date":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 09:08:31 -0400","replyTo":["CA+oWL+vyY1qaN6Fzew+PG5dtHNbGRKMdMZLdiBA9Wm3EjthjSA@mail.gmail.com"],"to":"philipcr@miamioh.edu","fromName":"<prvs=7364ca618=BLANKA1@nationwide.com>"},{"text":"AlexaThank you so much BestCodySent from my iPhone> On Oct 28 2015 at 908 AM BLANKA1@nationwide.com","subject":"Re: Offer Details","references":["OF1E70DB52.F930BF9E-ON85257EE6.006A6B66-85257EE6.006AE3BF@nationwide.com","CA+oWL+vyY1qaN6Fzew+PG5dtHNbGRKMdMZLdiBA9Wm3EjthjSA@mail.gmail.com","OFA678C183.70126DD7-ON85257EEC.004669C9-85257EEC.004830F8@nationwide.com"],"messageId":"5F8BA906-5E18-4BB2-9112-AD6485496E8F@miamioh.edu","priority":"normal","date":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 09:44:49 -0400","replyTo":["OFA678C183.70126DD7-ON85257EEC.004669C9-85257EEC.004830F8@nationwide.com"],"fromName":"<philipcr@miamioh.edu>"},{"text":"AlexaThank you for the call earlier.
