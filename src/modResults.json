In addition to the language, I was exposed to various frameworks, preprocessors, and build tools.  Prior to the boot camp, I worked as a digital marketer for a lean start up organization. From this opportunity, I gained project management experience while working independently and also in cross-functional teams.  I am passionate about writing efficient code through test driven development to produce an exceptional user experience. I am also driven to self-improvement by executing best practices and learning new techniques.  Please contact me at 734.775.8781 or ariellacentlivre@gmail.com to further discuss available opportunities. I look forward to speaking with you in the near future.  Subscribed to our newsletter.  ",
