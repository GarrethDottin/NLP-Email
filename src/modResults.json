I think I would learn a lot at Nationwide in this position but Iwant to be absolutely certain and I don't feel as if I can make aneducated decision without more time. I would like to request at least 1more week to make a decision on the offer 2 more weeks would be preferredbut I understand if that can not work for the company.
